    <h1>Daily Conversations</h1>
    <p>Innovative Language Learning (ILL) is a subscription based language learning app headquartered in Tokyo. I was a Video Project Manager responsible for developing new video series.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Daily Conversations&rsquo; series began as a request from Management team. Therefore, they wanted me to recycle an audio series that had previously only been available through the app into a video series for YouTube without recording new footage or audios.</p>
<p>Primarily, ILL gains new users through their 34 language specific YouTube channels.  The audios and transcripts were accessible however it was not clear how they wanted them produced. First, my role was creating the video prototype for management and before scaling the series to the video editors. The templates needed to accommodate the standards of each of 34 different language channel, this includes: typeface, pre-rolls, end-rolls, site bugs, colour schemes, text alignment, Ruby or non-Ruby text, and romanised or non-romanised text.</p>
<p>First, the prototype stage. I created a low-fidelity prototype for management to review. After they approved of the video structure, high-fidelity prototypes were published YouTube to gather viewer feedback.</p>
<p>Second, templates and workflow documentation for editors on the video team.</p>
<p>A scalable After Effects template, Premiere Pro template and workflow need to be designed.</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS</strong>
What was the outcome of the situation and what did you learn from the experience?</p>
<h4 id="approach"><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>First, similar to a wireframe, a low-fidelity prototype was created linking audio lesson sections together.</p>
<p>the sections together.</p>
<p>using audios I scripted and recorded.</p>
<p>using simple storyboard graphics for review by</p>
<p>focus group of higher management to provide stakeholder insight.</p>
<p>to  /</p>
<p>Second, a high-fidelity prototype was created</p>
<p>/ reports and statistics</p>
<p>Once approved, I requested assets by drafting a design request. The prototype went through several stages of design critique before the series scaled across YouTube channels.</p>
<p>– What was the ask? What were you trying to solve?
– What methodologies did you apply?</p>
<h4 id="results"><strong>Results</strong></h4>
<p>– Describe the end product.</p>
