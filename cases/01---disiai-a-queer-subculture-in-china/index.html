    <h1>Disiai: A Queer Subculture in China</h1>
    <p>I independently wrote a paper which was accepted by the the 110th Annual Convention of <strong>the National Communications Association</strong> in New Orleans, USA.</p>
<p>My paper, &ldquo;<strong>Disiai: A Queer Subculture in China</strong>&rdquo; explores China&rsquo;s LGBTQ+ community. It is a community which navigates social norms, legal frameworks, and cultural attitudes different to those of Western countries. Therefore the study was required to consider the unique cultural, philosophical and historical context of gender identity among the people of China.</p>
<p>Content analysis was used to support the netnographic study of &ldquo;Disiai&rdquo; (第四爱) subculture. Social posts were scraped using <code>wget</code> and <code>pup</code>. These findings revealed insights that bring into question the inclusively of the LGBTQ+ umbrella in contemporary Western thought.</p>
<p>My research goals were threefold:</p>
<p>First, through the exploration of cultural, philosophical, and historical factors my paper aims to elucidate cultural and contextual understanding of queer versus heterosexual identity in China. While highlighting importance cultural specificity connecting with China&rsquo;s LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>Second, my paper attempts to challenge Western-centric narratives and moral frameworks of sexuality; and aims to broaden readers perspectives to better equip them to engage in cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration.</p>
<p>Third, by exploring the Disiai community I hope to accurately record and introduce LGBTQ+ subcultures that are unique to China to a broader audience outside of China. To foster new perspectives on the fastest changing society in the world.</p>
<p>Overall, my ambition is that my contribute to cross-cultural gender studies encourages readers and attendees to critically reflect on their own assumptions of the LGBTQ+ umbrella in a global context enabling them to develop a more nuanced understanding of cross-cultural gender studies.</p>
<p>delves into the evolving dynamics of queer identity in one of the world&rsquo;s largest and most rapidly changing societies providing insights to the cultural limitations of gender studies research.</p>
